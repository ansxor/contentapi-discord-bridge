# markup

This code was taken directly from the old Discord bridge, and it renders using 12y.
There are places where improvements can be made and there are absolutely zero unit tests,
but it's necessary that markup does in fact work here.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run server.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
